# OSToolpack
Installer tool to setup debian based systems for OSINT investigations.


The intent of this installter is to create an autodownload/install method of quickly adding tools to your debian based linux distro. 

Roadmap:

v0.1 - Working script that will install all tools
v0.2 - Script will validate that all dependencies are met prior to installing tools
v0.3 - Script will allow you to customize which tools you would like to download by category.
v0.4 - will include browswer plugins for firefox
